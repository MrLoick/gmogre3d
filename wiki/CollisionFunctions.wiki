=== !CollidesWithObject(real fromx, real fromy, real fromz, real tox, real toy, real toz, real collision_radius, real min_height, real mask) ===
----
Returns whether or not a ray cast from the specified point to the specified point hits an object.

This function allows you to set a 'mask' to limit the results of this query to certain types of result. The actual meaning of this value is up to the application; basically objects will only be "hit" if a bitwise AND operation between this mask value and the object's query flags value is non-zero. The game will have to decide what each of the bits means. 

Note this checks the actual mesh of an object, and not the bounding box nor the Newton collision mesh.
====Parameters====
   * _fromx_, _fromy_, _fromz_ - The point to cast the ray from.
   * _tox_, _toy_, _toz_ - The point to cast the ray to.
   * _collision_radius_ - The radius of a sphere to use when detecting if the ray hit an object.  Ensures the ray does not go through a small hole in an object.
   * _min_height_ - Optional min height a collision can occur at.  Ensures that small objects, like rocks, can be ignored. Default is 0 height.
   * _mask_ - Optional mask used to determine if an object can be hit by the ray.  Defaults to hitting all objects.

=== !GetTerrainHeight(real x, real z) ===
----
Returns the height (z axis) of the terrain at the specified point on the x/y axis.
====Parameters====
   * _x_, _y_ - The point to cast the ray downward from.

=== !DistanceToCollisionWithObject(real fromx, real fromz, real fromy, real tox, real toz, real toy, real collision_radius, real min_height, real mask) ===
----
