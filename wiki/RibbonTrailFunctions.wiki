#summary Subclass of BillboardChain which automatically leaves a trail behind one or more Node instances.

An instance of this will watch one or more Node instances, and automatically generate a trail behind them as they move. Because this class can monitor multiple modes, it generates its own geometry in world space and thus, even though it has to be attached to a !SceneNode to be visible, changing the position of the !SceneNode it is attached to makes no difference to the geometry rendered. 

The 'head' element grows smoothly in size until it reaches the required size, then a new element is added. If the segment is full, the tail element shrinks by the same proportion as the head grows before disappearing. 

Elements can be faded out on a time basis, either by altering their colour or altering their alpha. The width can also alter over time. 

'v' texture coordinates are fixed at 0.0 if used, meaning that you can use a 1D texture to 'smear' a color pattern along the ribbon if you wish. The 'u' coordinates are by default (0.0, 1.0), but you can alter this using !SetRibbonTrailOtherTextureCoordRange if you wish.
