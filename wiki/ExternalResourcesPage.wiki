  * [http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/ OGRE API Reference] - This is for OGRE itself but can be used as a handy reference for GMOgre.  A lot of the documentation for GMOgre was taken directly from this.
  * [http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/ OGRE Manual] - This is for OGRE itself but is a good introduction to how OGRE, and thus GMOgre, works.
  * [http://www.ogre3d.org/forums OGRE Forums] - This forum is for OGRE and not GMOgre, but it's quite active and a great place to ask general OGRE questions.
