#summary Represents a Newton PlayerController object.

=== Overview ===
The Newton player controller object makes creating an FPS camera (normally a very daunting task) relatively easy. The interface is fairly simplistic, while internally it handles complicated tasks such as sliding along walls, walking up slopes, and even walking up stairs!

=== !CreateNewtonPlayerController(real newton_body_id, real max_stair_height, real kinematic_cushion) ===
----
Creates a new Newton player controller object and returns the ID.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_body_id_ - The ID of the Newton body.
<BR>

=== !DestroyNewtonPlayerController(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Destroys a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetNewtonPlayerControllerVelocity(real newton_player_controller_id, real forward_speed, real side_speed, real heading) ===
----
Sets the velocity of a NEwton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
   * _forward_speed_ - The speed to travel foward in.
   * _side_speed_ - The speed to travel sideways in. A positive value moves the player to the right.
   * _heading_ - The absolute space heading.
