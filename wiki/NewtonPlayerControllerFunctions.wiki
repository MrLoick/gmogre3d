#summary Represents a Newton PlayerController object.

=== Overview ===
The Newton player controller object makes creating an FPS camera (normally a very daunting task) relatively easy. The interface is fairly simplistic, while internally it handles complicated tasks such as sliding along walls, walking up slopes, and even walking up stairs!

=== !CreateNewtonPlayerController(real newton_body_id, real max_stair_height_factor, real max_slope, real kinematic_cushion) ===
----
Creates a new Newton player controller object and returns the ID.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_body_id_ - The ID of the Newton body.
   * _max_stair_height_factor_ - The maximum height factor of an object the player controller can walk over, normally used for max stair height. The default is 0.4.
   * _max_slope_ - The maximum number of degrees the player controller can move up a slope. The default is 30.
   * _kinematic_cushion_ - Optional kinematic cushion. The default, and minimum value, is 1.0f/64.0f.

=== !DestroyNewtonPlayerController(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Destroys a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetNewtonPlayerControllerVelocity(real newton_player_controller_id, real forward_speed, real side_speed, real direction) ===
----
Sets the velocity of a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
   * _forward_speed_ - The speed to travel forward in.
   * _side_speed_ - The speed to travel sideways in. A positive value moves the player to the right.
   * _direction_ - The direction (yaw) the player is facing, in degrees.

=== !GetNewtonPlayerControllerForwardVelocity(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Returns the forward velocity of a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !GetNewtonPlayerControllerSideVelocity(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Returns the sideways velocity of a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !GetNewtonPlayerControllerDirection(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Returns the direction (yaw) of a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !GetNewtonPlayerControllerPlayerHeight(real newton_player_controller_id) ===
----
Returns the player height of a Newton player controller object.
====Parameters====
   * _newton_player_controller_id_ - The ID of the Newton player controller.
