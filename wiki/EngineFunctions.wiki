#summary Engine functions are the base functions use to initialize, start, and stop GMOgre3D.
<br>
=== InitializeOgre3D() ===
----
Initializes the GMOgre3D engine.  This needs to be called before any other GMOgre3D functions are called.
<br>
<br>
<br>
=== IsOgre3DInitialized() ===
----
Returns true if the GMOgre3D engine has been initialized.
<br>
<br>
<br>
=== StartOgre3DEngine(real render_engine, real fsaa_type, real fsaa_hint, real enable_vsync) ===
----
Starts the GMOgre3D engine.  After calling this all drawing of the GM window is taken over by the GMOgre3D DLL.

FSAA type depends on the hardware, but usually can be 0, 2, 4, 8, 16.

====Parameters====
   * _render_engine_ - The type of renderer to use. Possible values are:
      * _RENDER_DX9_
      * _RENDER_GL_
   * _fsaa_type_ - Optional FSAA type. Typically can be 0, 2, 4, 8, 16. Default is 0.
   * _fsaa_hint - Optional FSAA hint. Value depends on the hardware, and currently can be:
      * _FSAA_HINT_NONE_ - No hint. This is default.
      * _FSAA_HINT_QUALITY_ - Prefer higher AA quality over speed.
   * _enable_vsync_ - Optionally enable or disable vsync. Default is disabled.
