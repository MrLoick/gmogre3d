#summary Allows the rendering of a chain of connected billboards.

=== Overview ===
A billboard chain operates much like a traditional billboard, i.e. its segments always face the camera; the difference being that instead of a set of disconnected quads, the elements in this class are connected together in a chain which must always stay in a continuous strip. This kind of effect is useful for creating effects such as trails, beams, lightning effects, etc. 

A single instance of this class can actually render multiple separate chain segments in a single render operation, provided they all use the same material. To clarify the terminology: a 'segment' is a separate sub-part of the chain with its own start and end (called the 'head' and the 'tail'. An 'element' is a single position / color / texcoord entry in a segment. You can add items to the head of a chain, and remove them from the tail, very efficiently. Each segment has a max size, and if adding an element to the segment would exceed this size, the tail element is automatically removed and re-used as the new item on the head. 

These functions have no auto-updating features to do things like alter the color of the elements or to automatically add / remove elements over time - you have to do all this yourself.

=== !SetBillboardChainRenderQueueGroup(real billboard_chain_id, real type) ===
----
Sets the render queue group this object will be rendered through.

Render queues are grouped to allow you to more tightly control the ordering of rendered objects. If you do not call this method, all objects default to the default queue, which is fine for most objects. You may want to alter this if you want this entity to always appear in front of other objects, e.g. for a 3D menu system or such. 
====Parameters====
   * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
   * _type_ - The render queue ID.  Can be:
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_BACKGROUND_ - Use this queue for objects which must be rendered first e.g. backgrounds.
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_SKIES_EARLY_ - First queue (after backgrounds), used for skyboxes if rendered first.
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_1_
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_2_
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_WORLD_GEOMETRY_1_
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_3_ 
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_4_
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_MAIN_ - The default render queue.

      * _RENDER_QUEUE_OVERLAY_ - Use this queue for objects which must be rendered last e.g. overlays.
      * _RENDER_QUEUE_MAX_ - Final possible render queue, don't exceed this.

=== !SetBillboardChainQueryFlags(real billboard_chain_id, real flags) ===
----
Sets the query flags for this object.

When performing a scene query, this entity will be included or excluded according to flags on the billboard chain and flags on the query. This is a bitwise value, so only when a bit on these flags is set, will it be included in a query asking for that flag. The meaning of the bits is application-specific.
====Parameters====
   * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
   * _flags_ - The application specific flags.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetBillboardChainLightFlags(real billboard_chain_id, real flags) ===
----
Set a bitwise mask which will filter the lights affecting this object. 

Specifies which lights may or may not affect this object.  This is a bitwise value, so only when a
bit on these flags match at least one bit in the light mask, will the light affect this object.  The
meaning of the bits is application-specific.
====Parameters====
    * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
    * _flags_ - The application specific flags.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetBillboardChainVisibilityFlags(real billboard_chain_id, real flags) ===
----
Sets the visibility flags for this object.

As well as a simple true/false value for visibility (as seen in setVisible), you can also set visiblity flags which when 'and'ed with the SceneManager's visibility mask can also make an object invisible.
====Parameters====
   * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
   * _flags_ - The visibility flags.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetBillboardChainUserData(real billboard_chain_id, string key, real data) ===
----
Sets any kind of user value on this object.

This function allows you to associate any user value you like with this object. This can be a pointer to a GM object for instance.  Use a unique key to distinguish between each of these objects.
====Parameters====
   * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
   * _key_ - The string key that this data is associate with.
   * _data_ - The data to associate with this object.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !GetBillboardChainUserData(real billboard_chain_id, string key) ===
----
Gets the user value on this object.
====Parameters====
   * _billboard_chain_id_ - The ID of the billboard chain.
   * _key_ - The string key of the data to retrieve.
