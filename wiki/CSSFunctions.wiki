#summary A set of functions for pre-made camera modes.

=== Overview ===
GMOgre3D provides a powerful camera system, supporting both perspective projection and orthographic projection, different styles of rendering, field of view, etc. but its control (or animation) relies completely on the programmer.

The Camera Control System is a set of functions that allows a programmer to easily create and manipulate commonly used camera modes.
