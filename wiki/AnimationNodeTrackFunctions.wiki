=== !CreateAnimationNodeTrackNodeKeyFrame(real anim_node_id, real time) ===
----
Creates a new KeyFrame and adds it to an animation at the given time index.

It is better to create KeyFrames in time order. Creating them out of order can result in expensive reordering processing. Note that a KeyFrame at time index 0.0 is always created for you, so you don't need to create this one, just access it using !GetAnimationNodeKeyFrame(0); 
====Parameters====
   * _anim_node_id_ - The ID of the animation node.
   * _time_ - The time from which this KeyFrame will apply.
