#summary Represents the state of a single texture unit during a Pass of a Technique, of a Material.

Texture units are pipelines for retrieving texture data for rendering onto your objects in the world. Using them is common to both the fixed-function and the programmable (vertex and fragment program) pipeline, but some of the settings will only have an effect in the fixed-function pipeline (for example, setting a texture rotation will have no effect if you use the programmable pipeline, because this is overridden by the fragment program). The effect of each setting as regards the 2 pipelines is commented in each setting. 

When I use the term 'fixed-function pipeline' I mean traditional rendering where you do not use vertex or fragment programs (shaders). Programmable pipeline means that for this pass you are using vertex or fragment programs.

=== !SetTextureUnitStateTextureName(real texture_unit_id, string tex_name) ===
----

=== !SetTextureUnitStateCubicTextureNames(real texture_unit_id, string tex_name1, string tex_name2, string tex_name3, string tex_name4, string tex_name5, string tex_name6, real for_uvw) ===
----
Sets a texture layer to use a combination of 6 texture maps, each one relating to a face of a cube.

Cubic textures are made up of 6 separate texture images. Each one of these is an orthoganal view of the world with a FOV of 90 degrees and an aspect ratio of 1:1. You can generate these from 3D Studio by rendering a scene to a reflection map of a transparent cube and saving the output files. 

Cubic maps can be used either for skyboxes (complete wrap-around skies, like space) or as environment maps to simulate reflections. The system deals with these 2 scenarios in different ways:
   # For cubic environment maps, the 6 textures are combined into a single 'cubic' texture map which is then addressed using 3D texture coordinates. This is required because you don't know what face of the box you're going to need to address when you render an object, and typically you need to reflect more than one face on the one object, so all 6 textures are needed to be 'active' at once. Cubic environment maps are enabled by calling this method with the _for_uvw_ parameter set to true, and then calling !EnableTextureUnitStateEnvironmentMap(id, true). Note that not all cards support cubic environment mapping.
   # For skyboxes, the 6 textures are kept separate and used independently for each face of the skybox. This is done because not all cards support 3D cubic maps and skyboxes do not need to use 3D texture coordinates so it is simpler to render each face of the box with 2D coordinates, changing texture between faces. Skyboxes are created by calling !SetSkyBox. 

Applies to both fixed-function and programmable pipeline. 
====Parameters====
   * _texture_unit_id_ - The ID of the texture unit state object.
   * _tex_name1_ ... _tex_name6_ - The 6 texture names.
   * _for_uvw_ - Optional parameter.  Set to true if you want a single 3D texture addressable with 3D texture coordinates rather than 6 separate textures. Useful for cubic environment mapping.  Defaults to false if not passed.

=== !SetTextureUnitStateTextureCoordSet(real texture_unit_id, real set) ===

This option has no effect in the programmable pipeline. 
====Parameters====
   * _texture_unit_id_ - The ID of the texture unit state object.
   * _speed_ - The number of complete anticlockwise revolutions per second (use -ve for clockwise).
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetTextureUnitStateTransformAnimation(real texture_unit_id, real transform_type, real wave_type, real base, real frequency, real phase, real amplitude) ===
----
Sets up a general time-relative texture modification effect.

This can be called multiple times for different values of _transform_type_, but only the latest effect applies if called multiple time for the same _transform_type_. 
====Parameters====
   * _texture_unit_id_ - The ID of the texture unit state object.
   * _transform_type_ - The type of transform (translate (scroll), scale (stretch) or rotate (spin)).  Can be:

      * TT_TRANSLATE_V 	
      * TT_SCALE_U	
      * TT_SCALE_V	
      * TT_ROTATE 
   * _wave_type_ - The shape of the wave.  Can be:
      * _WFT_SINE_ - Standard sine wave which smoothly changes from low to high and back again.
      * _WTF_TRIANGLE_ - An angular wave with a constant increase/decrease speed with pointed peaks.
      * _WTF_SQUARE_ - Half of the time is spent at the min, half at the max with instant transition between.
      * _WTF_SAWTOOTH_ - Gradual steady increase from min to max over the period with an instant return to min a the end.
      * _WTF_INVERSE_SAWTOOTH_ - Gradual steady decrease from max to min over the period with an instant return to max a the end.
      * _WTF_PWM_ - Pulse Width Modulation.  Works like WFT_SQUARE, except the high to low transition is controlled by duty cycle.  With a duty cycle of 50% (0.5) will give the same output as WFT_SQUARE.
   * _base_ - The base value for the function (range of output = {base, base + amplitude}).
   * _frequency_ - The speed of the wave in cycles per second.
   * _phase_ - The offset of the start of the wave, e.g. 0.5 to start half-way through the wave.
   * _amplitude_ - Scales the output so that instead of lying within 0..1 it lies within 0..1 x amplitude for exaggerated effects.

=== !SetTextureUnitStateContentType(real texture_unit_id, real type) ===
----

   * _type_ - The content type. Can be:
      * _CONTENT_NAMED_ - Normal texture identified by name.

=== !SetTextureUnitStateColorOperation(real texture_unit_id, real type) ===
----
Determines how this texture layer is combined with the one below it (or the diffuse colour of the geometry if this is layer 0).

This function is the simplest way to blend texture layers, because it requires only one parameter, gives you the most common blending types, and automatically sets up 2 blending methods: one for if single-pass multitexturing hardware is available, and another for if it is not and the blending must be achieved through multiple rendering passes. It is, however, quite limited and does not expose the more flexible multitexturing operations, simply because these can't be automatically supported in multipass fallback mode.

The default method is LBO_MODULATE for all layers.

This option has no effect in the programmable pipeline.
====Parameters====
   * _texture_unit_id_ - The ID of the texture unit state object.
   * _type_ - The content type. Can be:
      * _LBO_REPLACE_ - Replace all color with texture with no adjustment.
      * _LBO_ADD_ - Add color components together.
      * _LBO_MODULATE_ - Multiple color components together.
      * _LBO_ALPHA_BLEND_ - Blend based on texture alpha.

=== !EnableTextureUnitStateEnvironmentMap(real texture_unit_id, real enable, real type) ===
----
Enables or disables texture coordinate effect that makes this layer an environment map.

Environment maps make an object look reflective by using the object's vertex normals relative to the camera view to generate texture coordinates. 

The vectors generated can either be used to address a single 2D texture which is a 'fish-eye' lens view of a scene, or a 3D cubic environment map which requires 6 textures for each side of the inside of a cube. The type depends on what texture you set up - if you use the !SetTextureUnitStateTextureName method then a 2D fisheye lens texture is required, whereas if you used !SetTextureUnitStateCubicTextureName then a cubic environemnt map will be used. 

This effect works best if the object has lots of gradually changing normals. The texture also has to be designed for this effect - see the example spheremap.png included with the sample application for a 2D environment map; a cubic map can be generated by rendering 6 views of a scene to each of the cube faces with orthoganal views. 

Enabling this disables any other texture coordinate generation effects. However it can be combined with texture coordinate modification functions, which then operate on the generated coordinates rather than static model texture coordinates. 

This option has no effect in the programmable pipeline. 
====Parameters====
   * _texture_unit_id_ - The ID of the texture unit state object.
   * _enable_ - True to enable, false to disable.
   * _type_ - The environment map type. Can be:
      * _ENV_PLANAR_ - Envmap based on vector from camera to vertex position, good for planar geometry.
      * _ENV_CURVED_ - Envmap based on dot of vector from camera to vertex and vertex normal, good for curves.
      * _ENV_REFLECTION_ - Envmap intended to supply reflection vectors for cube mapping.
      * _ENV_NORMAL_ - Envmap intended to supply normal vectors for cube mapping.
