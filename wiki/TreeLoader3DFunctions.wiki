#summary A PageLoader-derived object you can use with PagedGeometry to easily place trees on your terrain.

=== Introduction ===
Using a TreeLoader is simple - simply create an instance, attach it to your !PagedGeometry object with SetPagedGeometryPageLoader(), and add your trees.

To add trees, just call AddTreeLoader3DTree(), supplying the appropriate parameters. You may notice that TreeLoader3D restricts trees to uniform scale and yaw rotation. This is done to conserve memory; TreeLoader3D packs trees into memory as efficiently as possible, taking only 10 bytes per tree. This means 1 million trees takes 9.53 MB of RAM (additionally, adding 1 million trees takes less than a second).

Note that using TreeLoader2D uses 40% less memory than TreeLoader3D.
