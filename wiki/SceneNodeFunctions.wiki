#summary Represents a node in the scene graph.

=== Overview ===
A scene node is a type of Node which is used to organize objects in a scene. It has the ability to attach world objects to the node, and stores hierarchical bounding volumes of the nodes in the tree. Child nodes are contained within the bounds of the parent, and so on down the tree, allowing for fast culling. 
<BR>
<BR>
=== !GetRootSceneNode() ===
----
Gets the scene node at the root of the scene hierarchy.

The entire scene is held as a hierarchy of nodes, which allows things like relative transforms, general changes in rendering state etc. There is only ever one root node of the hierarchy, and this function returns a pointer to it. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
=== !CreateSceneNode() ===
----
Creates an instance of a scene node and returns the ID.

Note that this does not add the scene node to the scene hierarchy. This function is for convenience, since it allows an instance to be created for which the !SceneManager is responsible for allocating and releasing memory, which is convenient in complex scenes. 

To include the returned scene node in the scene, use the !AddChildSceneNode function to specify a parent. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
=== !CreateRootChildSceneNode(real x, real y, real z, real yaw, real pitch, real roll) ===
----
Creates a scene node, adds it as a child of the root scene node, and returns the ID.
====Parameters====
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - The world coordinates of the scene node.
   * _yaw_ - The yaw of the scene node.
   * _pitch_ - The pitch of the scene node.
   * _roll_ - The roll of the scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !CreateChildSceneNode(real scene_node_id, real x, real y, real z, real yaw, real pitch, real roll) ===
----
Creates a scene node, adds it as a child of the specified scene node, and returns the ID.
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the parent scene node.
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - The coordinates of the scene node relative to its parent.
   * _yaw_ - The yaw of the scene node relative to its parent.
   * _pitch_ - The pitch of the scene node relative to its parent.
   * _roll_ - The roll of the scene node relative to its parent.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !DestroySceneNode(real scene_node_id) ===
----
Destroys a scene node.

This allows you to physically delete an individual scene node if you want to. Note that this is not normally recommended, it's better to allow GMOgre3D to delete the nodes when the scene is cleared. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !AddChildSceneNode(real parent_scene_node_id, real scene_node_id) ===
----
Adds a pre-created scene node as a child to the specified scene node.  If it is attached to another node, it must be detached first. 
====Parameters====
   * _parent_scene_node_id_ - The ID of the parent scene node.
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the child scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !RemoveChildSceneNode(real parent_scene_node_id, real scene_node_id) ===
----
Drops child scene node from the specified parent scene node.

Does not delete the scene node, just detaches it from this parent, potentially to be reattached elsewhere.
====Parameters====
   * _parent_scene_node_id_ - The ID of the parent scene node.
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the child scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !EnableSceneNodeInheritScale(real scene_node_id, real enable) ===
----
Tells the node whether it should inherit scaling factors from it's parent node.

Scaling factors, unlike other transforms, are not always inherited by child nodes. Whether or not scalings affect the size of the child nodes depends on the !SetSceneNodeInheritScale option of the child. In some cases you want a scaling factor of a parent node to apply to a child node (e.g. where the child node is a part of the same object, so you want it to be the same relative size based on the parent's size), but not in other cases (e.g. where the child node is just for positioning another object, you want it to maintain it's own size). The default is to inherit as with other transforms. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the child scene node.
   * _enable_ - Whether to inherit scale.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetSceneNodeScale(real scene_node_id, real x, real y, real z) ===
----
Sets the scaling factor applied to a scene node.

Scaling factors, unlike other transforms, are not always inherited by child nodes. Whether or not scalings affect the size of the child nodes depends on the !EnableSceneNodeInheritScale option of the child. In some cases you want a scaling factor of a parent node to apply to a child node (e.g. where the child node is a part of the same object, so you want it to be the same relative size based on the parent's size), but not in other cases (e.g. where the child node is just for positioning another object, you want it to maintain it's own size). The default is to inherit as with other transforms. 

Note that like rotations, scalings are oriented around the node's origin. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - The local coordinates of the scene node.
<BR>

<BR>
=== !EnableSceneNodeInheritOrientation(real scene_node_id, real enable) ===
----
Tells the node whether it should inherit orientation from it's parent node.

Orientations, unlike other transforms, are not always inherited by child nodes. Whether or not orientations affect the orientation of the child nodes depends on the !SetSceneNodeInheritOrientation option of the child. In some cases you want a orientating of a parent node to apply to a child node (e.g. where the child node is a part of the same object, so you want it to be the same relative orientation based on the parent's orientation), but not in other cases (e.g. where the child node is just for positioning another object, you want it to maintain it's own orientation). The default is to inherit as with other transforms. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the child scene node.
   * _enable_ - Whether to inherit orientation.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !SetSceneNodeOrientation(real scene_node_id, real yaw, real pitch, real roll) ===
----
Sets a scene node's orientation (yaw, pitch, and roll). 

Orientations, unlike other transforms, are not always inherited by child nodes. Whether or not orientations affect the orientation of the child nodes depends on the !EnableSceneNodeInheritOrientation option of the child. In some cases you want a orientating of a parent node to apply to a child node (e.g. where the child node is a part of the same object, so you want it to be the same relative orientation based on the parent's orientation), but not in other cases (e.g. where the child node is just for positioning another object, you want it to maintain it's own orientation). The default is to inherit as with other transforms.

=== !ResetSceneNodeOrientation(real scene_node_id) ===
----
Resets a scene nodes orientation (local axes as world axes, no rotation).

Orientations, unlike other transforms, are not always inherited by child nodes. Whether or not orientations affect the orientation of the child nodes depends on the !SetSceneNodeInheritOrientation option of the child. In some cases you want a orientating of a parent node to apply to a child node (e.g. where the child node is a part of the same object, so you want it to be the same relative orientation based on the parent's orientation), but not in other cases (e.g. where the child node is just for positioning another object, you want it to maintain it's own orientation). The default is to inherit as with other transforms.

=== !SetSceneNodeInitialState(real scene_node_id) ===
----
Sets the current transform of this node to be the 'initial state' ie that position / orientation / scale to be used as a basis for delta values used in keyframe animation.

You never need to call this function unless you plan to animate this node. If you do plan to animate it, call this method once you've loaded the node with it's base state, ie the state on which all keyframes are based. 

If you never call this function, the initial state is the identity transform, ie do nothing. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !EnableSceneNodeAutoTracking(real scene_node_id, real enable, real target_scene_node_id, real x, real y, real z) ===
----
Enables or disables automatic tracking of a scene node.

If you enable auto-tracking, this scene node will automatically rotate to look at the target scene node every frame, no matter how it or the
target scene node moves. This is handy if you want a scene node to be focused on a single object or group of objects. Note that by default a scene node looks at the origin of the target scene node. If you want to tweak this, e.g. if the object which is attached to this target node is quite big and you want to point the scene node at a specific point on it, provide a vector in the 'offset' parameter and the scene node's target point will be adjusted.
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
   * _enabled_ - If true, the Camera will track the SceneNode supplied as the next parameter (cannot be null). If false the camera will cease tracking and will remain in it's current orientation.
   * _target_scene_node_id_ - If supplied, the scene node to track. Make sure you don't delete this scene node before turning off tracking (e.g. ClearScene will delete it so be careful of this). Can be      left out if the enable param is false.
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - If supplied, the scene node targets this point in local space of the target node instead of the origin of the target node. Good for fine tuning the look at point. 
<BR>
<BR>
=== !ShowSceneNode(real scene_node_id) ===
----
Makes all objects attached to this node become visible.

This is a shortcut to calling the same function on all objects attached to this node, and optionally to all objects attached to child nodes. 
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !HideSceneNode(real scene_node_id) ===
----
Makes all objects attached to this node become invisible.

This is a shortcut to calling the same function on all objects attached to this node, and optionally to all objects attached to child nodes.
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.

   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
<BR>
<BR>
=== AttachSceneNodeToGMInstance(real scene_node_id, real gm_instance_id) ===
----
This attaches a single GM object to a scene node.

When attached the scene node will automatically update it's position and orientation each frame using the values stored in the GM object's x/y/z and direction/pitch/roll variables.  Not only does this ensure you do not need to update the scene node manually every frame, but is actually a much faster way to update scene nodes than to make multiple DLL calls each frame.

Note that you absolutely MUST detach the scene node from the GM object before deleting the GM object!
====Parameters====
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node.
   * _gm_instance_id_ - The ID of the GM object.
<BR>
<BR>
