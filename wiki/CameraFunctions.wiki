#summary A viewpoint from which the scene will be rendered.

=== Overview ===
GMOgre3D renders scenes from a camera viewpoint into a buffer of some sort, normally a window or a texture. GMOgre3D cameras support both perspective projection (the default, meaning objects get smaller the further away they are) and orthographic projection (blueprint-style, no decrease in size with distance). Each camera carries with it a style of rendering, e.g. full textured, flat shaded, wireframe), field of view, rendering distances etc, allowing you to use GMOGre3D to create complex multi-window views if required. In addition, more than one camera can point at a single render target if required, each rendering to a subset of the target, allowing split screen and picture-in-picture views. 

Cameras maintain their own aspect ratios, field of view, and frustum.  At render time, the camera will be rendering to a Viewport. Obviously it is advisable that the viewport has the same aspect ratio as the camera to avoid distortion (unless you want it!). 

Note that a Camera can be attached to a !SceneNode, using the method !AttachCameraToSceneNode. If this is done the Camera will combine it's own position/orientation settings with it's parent !SceneNode. This is useful for implementing more complex Camera / object relationships i.e. having a camera attached to a world object.

=== SetCameraLODBias(real camera_id, real factor) ===
----
Sets a camera's level-of-detail factor. This method can be used to influence the overall level of detail of the scenes rendered using this camera. Various elements of the scene have level-of-detail reductions to improve rendering speed at distance; this method allows you to hint to those elements that you would like to adjust the level of detail that they would normally use (up or down). 

The most common use for this method is to reduce the overall level of detail used for a secondary camera used for sub viewports like rear-view mirrors etc. Note that scene elements are at liberty to ignore this setting if they choose, this is merely a hint.
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _factor_ - The The factor to apply to the usual level of detail calculation. Higher values increase the detail, so 2.0 doubles the normal detail and 0.5 halves it.
<BR>
<BR>
=== GetCameraLODBias(real camera_id) ===
----
Returns a camera's level-of-detail factor.
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !EnableCameraAutoTracking(real camera_id, real enable, real scene_node_id, real x, real y, real z) ===
----
Enables or disables automatic tracking of a !SceneNode. If you enable auto-tracking, this Camera will automatically rotate to look at the target !SceneNode every frame, no matter how it or !SceneNode move. This is handy if you want a Camera to be focused on a single object or group of objects. Note that by default a Camera looks at the origin of the !SceneNode, if you want to tweak this, e.g. if the object which is attached to this target node is quite big and you want to point the camera at a specific point on it, provide a vector in the 'offset' parameter and a camera's target point will be adjusted.
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _enabled_ - If true, the Camera will track the !SceneNode supplied as the next parameter (cannot be null). If false the camera will cease tracking and will remain in it's current orientation.
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node to track. Make sure you don't delete this !SceneNode before turning off tracking (e.g. !ClearScene will delete it so be careful of this). Can be left out if the enable param is false.
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - If supplied, the camera targets this point in local space of the target node instead of the origin of the target node. Good for fine tuning the look at point.

<BR>
=== !EnableCameraFixedYawAxis(real camera_id, real enable, real x, real y, real z) ===
----
Tells a camera whether to yaw around it's own local Z axis or a fixed axis of choice.

By default, the camera yaws around a fixed Z axis. This is often what you want - for example if you're making a first-person shooter, you really don't want the yaw axis to reflect the local camera Z, because this would mean a different yaw axis if the player is looking upwards rather than when they are looking straight ahead. You can change this behavior by calling this method, which you will want to do if you are making a completely free camera like the kind used in a flight simulator. 
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _enabled_ - If true, the axis passed in the second parameter will always be the yaw axis no matter what the camera orientation. If false, the camera yaws around the local Z.
   * _x_, _y_, _z_ - The axis to use if the first parameter is true.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !EnableCameraReflection(real camera_id, real enable, real plane_id) ===
----
Enable or disables a camera's reflection of itself through the plane specified.  This is obviously useful for performing planar reflections. 
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _enabled_ - Whether to enable to disable reflections.
   * _plane_id_ - The ID of the plane that will render the reflection.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !AttachCameraToSceneNode(real camera_id, real scene_node_id) ===
----
Attaches a camera to a !SceneNode.
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node to attach the camera to.
<BR>
<BR>
=== !DetachCameraFromSceneNode(real camera_id, real scene_node_id) ===
----
Detaches a camera from a !SceneNode.
====Parameters====
   * _camera_id_ - The ID of the camera.
   * _scene_node_id_ - The ID of the scene node to detach the camera from.
